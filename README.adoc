SAML2test is a tests tool that will allow an independent validation
of a specific instance of a SAML2 entity. It will test not only if the
instance works according to the SAML2 standard but also if it complies
with a specific profile of SAML2.

The focus ot the test suite is around federation profiles, such as the
Kantara federation interop and saml2int profiles. Entities need to support
the SAML Metadata Interoperability profile.
