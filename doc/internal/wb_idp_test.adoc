= How to run IDP tests with the web interface

== Overview

In this setup the Test Target (TT) is an IDP, and the Test Driver (TD) is an embedded entity
of the test tool.

idp_test.py is a web server. It provides a

== Command Line Usage

    idp_test.py [-j] [-m] -o <OUTPUTFILE>
        -j  Generate JSON config format from config dir
        -m  Write metadata
        -o  Output file


=== Examples

==== Generators

    Writing metadata: idp_test.py -m -o <OUTPUTFILE>
    Write config in json format: idp_test.py -j -o <OUTPUTFILE>


== Switching config

=== Userdefined configs

Users have only access to the web-interface and are able to override the config (partly, of course) with
their own configuration stored on github. Loading and switching to such a config is done by a GET request:

    <URL>/swconf?github=<GITHUB-REPO-NAME>&email=<USER-EMAIL>

Example:

    http://localhost:8087/swconf?github=myuser/saml2test2-github-config-repo&email=me@example.org

=== Restricting Users

Users ability to switch to another config by creating a yaml file, holding lines of the form

   <GITHUB-USERNAME>: <USER-EMAIL>

and defining the file in the config using:

   def config(self):
      ...
      self.ACCESS_CONTROL_FILE = '<FILENAME>'
