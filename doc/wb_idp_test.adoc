= How to run an IDP test with the web interface

== Test Configuration

The test tool requires 2 types of configuration to be passed at invocation time:

|=====
|ID|Name in example|Contents
|TOOL-CONFIG|test_tool.yaml| test target entityid & metadata source, test flows and profile filter, template and static dirs
|TD-CONFIG|conf.py| List of test driver entities in pysaml2-style
|=====

The 2 main configuration files reference more files.

.Referenced configurations
|=====
|Name in example|referenced from ID|Contents
|flows.yaml (or .json)|TOOL-CONFIG|defines test flows and their order of execution
|conf.py|TD-CONFIG|defines metadata, interaction scripts, logging and miscellaneous paramters
|tt_metadata.xml|TT_METADATA|Metadata aggregate that needs to contain the test target's entityID
|=====


- Generated configurations
|=====
|Name in example|referenced from ID|generated by|Contents
|sps.xml|really used?|mk_multi_metadata.py|SAML EntityDescriptor for the test driver
|=====


== Test Execution

    idp_test.py [-k] [-x] [-t test-id] -T <TOOL-CONFIG> TD-CONFIG

This command starts the web server. Setup should install it in your path.
Open the test interface on localhost:8087.
