= HowTo: Test an IDP

== Prepare the test configuration
You need to prepare the test target configuration and add the test driver's
metadata (usually comprising multiple entities) to the test target's entity feed.
Lets get started with configuring a series of tests for a single IDP:

=== Modify the default configuration:

- Copy the template configuration project:
  https://github.com/identinetics/s2t2.conf

    # assume your repo is named samltest_idpExampleOrg, your git id is jo123
    CONF_REPO='samltest_idpExampleOrg'
    mkdir $CONF_REPO && cd $CONF_REPO
    git clone https://github.com/identinetics/s2t2.conf .
    rm -rf .git && git init  # replace the original repo with a new one

- Adapt the test configuration:

    There are, by default, 4 config files arranged in following (class) hierarchy:
     1. config_abstr.py   (importing default config from source code repo)
     2. config_driver.py  (test driver - no need to change unless extending test cases)
     3. config_profile.py (test flows and saml profile)
     4. config.py         (test target config & interaction)

- Generate the json-formatted configuration:

    ./make_json.sh.sh  # you need to have docker for linux/osx/windows installed
    git add --all && git commit -m 'my modification'

- Your repo will now contain 2 files:

    generated/config.json  # your consolidated test target configuration
    generated/metdata.xml  # your test drivers metadata to be used by the test target

- Save your configuration on github

    git remote add origin https://github.com/jo123/$CONF_REPO
    git push origin master

- Note: You may use the fork and clone workflow, but you are limited to one fork
   per project. If you will be testing multiple test targets you will need more
   than one repo.

== Executing tests with a custom configuration

Users have only access to the web-interface and are able to override the config (partly,
of course) with their own configuration stored on github. Loading and switching to such
a config is done by a GET request:

    http://webui.samltest.fed-lab.org:8087/swconf?github=<GITHUB-USER/GITHUB-REPO-NAME>&email=<USER-EMAIL>

Example:

    http://webui.samltest.fed-lab.org:8087/swconf?github=myuser/saml2test2-github-config-repo&email=me@example.org

=== Restricting Users

Users ability to switch to another config by creating a yaml file, holding lines of the form

   <GITHUB-USERNAME>: <USER-EMAIL>

and defining the file in the config using:

   def config(self):
      ...
      self.ACCESS_CONTROL_FILE = '<FILENAME>'
