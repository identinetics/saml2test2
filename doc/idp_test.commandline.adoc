= Commandline usage of idp_test.py

== Running the server
idp_test.py <config dir>

== Metadata generation
.to stdout
idp_test.py -m <config dir>

.into a file
idp_test.py -o <output file> -m <config dir>

== Json generation
JSON data will be generated in a sub directory of the config as config.json. The metadata file is also
generated. Once generated, the config directory can be pushed to github.

idp_test.py -j <config dir>

NOTE: The json data are just a replacement for the python files, but all other files
 are still needed.

== Run a config from github
Cloning a github repository as a config directory.

idp_test.py -g <github uri>

NOTE: by now, the server is not able to upload metadata into the IDP.

== Reading JSON
JSON data is expected to be in <config dir>/generated/config.json

idp_test.py -r
